            <p> Hello, I'm Yasmine - a Web Developer that decided to jump out of almost a decade working in the B2B industry realizing there was a gap between business expectations and what was delivered by developers. Passionate about technology I've decided to become a Developer myself bringing creativity, problem solving and business experience to the table. 
            <br> 
            I am a Fullstack Web Developer working with Ruby on Rails, React, React Native, Angular, HTML and CSS.
            <br>
            Always open for new ideas and projects partnership!
            </p>
